Attending Physician: Dr. Robert Chen, MD (NPI: 1234567890)

Doctor: Good morning, Maria. I'm Dr. Chen. I see you were referred by Dr. Williams from Rush University Medical Center.
Patient: Yes, Dr. Williams said I should see a specialist about my test results.

Doctor: I've reviewed your labs from LabCorp dated December 20th. Your HIV test came back positive. I understand this must be difficult news.
Patient: I... I suspected it might be. My ex-partner, David Martinez, told me he tested positive last month.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll need to start you on antiretroviral therapy. Have you shared this diagnosis with anyone else?
Patient: Only my sister, Ana Gonzalez, who lives at 456 Oak Street, Evanston, IL. She's been very supportive.

Doctor: That's good to have support. Now, regarding your mental health, I see you're currently being treated for bipolar disorder at Northwestern Psychiatry Center. Are you still taking lithium?
Patient: Yes, 900mg daily. I also see Dr. Patricia O'Connor for therapy every Tuesday at 3pm.

Doctor: Perfect. We'll need to coordinate your HIV medications with your psychiatric care. I'm also noting you have a history of substance abuse - the records show you completed rehab at Hazelden Betty Ford in Minnesota in 2020.
Patient: That's correct. I've been sober for 4 years now.

Doctor: Excellent progress. Let me also verify - your emergency contact is your mother, Carmen Gonzalez, reachable at 555-0198?
Patient: Yes, but please don't call her about the HIV diagnosis. I haven't told her yet.

Doctor: Understood. We'll protect your privacy. Now, I'm prescribing Biktarvy. Your insurance, Blue Cross Blue Shield, policy number BCBS-2024-556677, should cover this.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor.

Doctor: One more thing - I noticed your employer, Chicago Public Schools, offers an employee wellness program. You might want to consider their mental health resources.
Patient: I'd rather keep my work separate from this.

Doctor: Of course. We'll schedule a follow-up for January 10th, 2025. The nurse will give you educational materials and the clinic contact: hivcare@chicagomed.org.
